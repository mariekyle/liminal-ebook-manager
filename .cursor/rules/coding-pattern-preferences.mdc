# Coding Pattern Preferences

## Core Rules (The Essentials)
1. ALWAYS check existing code before making changes
2. NEVER modify .env files without asking first
3. Don't add features that weren't requested
4. If something seems like it might break existing features, mention it

## Current Project Structure
- Backend: FastAPI in backend/main.py (will be refactored later)
- Frontend: React in frontend/src/App.js (will be split up later)
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
- This structure is temporary - we're planning to refactor

## When Making Changes
- Keep changes focused on what was asked
- If you notice something that could be improved, mention it but don't implement unless asked
- Test that existing features still work after changes

## Note
This project is in early stages. Architecture will evolve. These rules will too.
