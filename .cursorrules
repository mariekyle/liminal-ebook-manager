# Liminal - Ebook Library Manager

## Project Overview
Self-hosted web app for managing an ebook library on Synology NAS.
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI + SQLite
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Docker on Synology NAS

## Golden Rules

1. **DO NOT remove, overwrite, or "clean up" any unrelated feature.**
   - If you see code that seems unused, ASK before removing it
   - Features may be called from places you haven't seen yet

2. **Modify only the code related to the specific bug/feature named.**
   - Stay focused on what was asked
   - Don't refactor "while you're in there"

3. **Output minimal, surgical changes.**
   - Show only the specific lines/functions being changed
   - No full file rewrites unless explicitly rebuilding from scratch

4. **Do not delete imports, classes, or methods unless explicitly approved.**
   - Even if they appear unused
   - Ask first: "I notice X isn't being used - should I remove it?"

5. **After every change, summarize:**
   - What changed
   - What was preserved/verified unchanged

## Protected Systems (ask before modifying)

- **Gradient cover generation** (`services/covers.py`, `GradientCover.jsx`)
- **Metadata extraction** (`services/metadata.py`)
- **Database schema** (`database.py`)
- **Folder name parsing** (`routers/sync.py` - parse_folder_name function)

## Architecture Notes

### Data Flow
```
Folder scan → Parse folder name (title/author/series)
            → Extract EPUB metadata (year/summary/tags/words)
            → Merge data (folder wins for title/author)
            → Save to SQLite
            → Display in React frontend
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Folder name is source of truth** for title, author, series
- **EPUB metadata enriches** with year, summary, tags, word count
- **Books are read-only** - app never modifies book files
- **SQLite for simplicity** - single file database

## File Structure
```
backend/
  main.py           - FastAPI app entry point
  database.py       - SQLite schema and init
  routers/
    books.py        - List/search/filter books, notes CRUD
    sync.py         - Folder scanning, metadata extraction
  services/
    metadata.py     - EPUB/PDF metadata extraction
    covers.py       - Gradient cover color generation

frontend/src/
  App.jsx           - Main app with routing
  api.js            - Backend API wrapper
  components/
    Library.jsx     - Book grid with filters
    BookCard.jsx    - Individual book card
    BookDetail.jsx  - Book page with notes
    GradientCover.jsx - CSS gradient covers
```

## Naming Conventions
- Never use "FINAL" in filenames - this project evolves continuously
- Use descriptive names: `fix-cover-text-shadow` not `update-v2`
- Changelog files: `YYYYMMDD_description.md`

## When Making Changes

### Before coding:
- Confirm which specific file(s) and function(s) to modify
- Check if the area touches any protected systems

### While coding:
- Make the minimum change necessary
- Preserve all existing imports and functions
- Add new code rather than replacing when possible

### After coding:
- List what changed
- Confirm what stayed the same
- Note any side effects or areas to test
