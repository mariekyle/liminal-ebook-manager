## Vision

Liminal is a personal reading companion that eliminates the friction of managing an ebook library across multiple systems. It provides a single, mobile-friendly home for browsing, tracking, discovering, and reflecting on books — both owned and wished for — so that the reader can spend less time managing and more time in the liminal space of reading.

## Technical Debt

Items to address when time permits (not blocking migration):

### Checklist Collection Pagination Infinite Loop ⚠️
**Location:** `CollectionDetail.jsx`  
**Symptom:** Scrolling to bottom of large checklist collections causes infinite spinner flicker.  
**Workaround:** Visual noise only, collection still usable.  
**Priority:** Medium

### Browser Cache Issues with Covers
**Symptom:** Cover changes may not reflect immediately after editing many covers.  
**Workaround:** Clear browser cache for past hour.  
**Priority:** Low

### TBRList → Wishlist Rename
**Location:** `TBRList.jsx`  
**Issue:** File still named TBRList. Storage key already fixed.  
**Status:** Deferred to React Native migration.  
**Priority:** Low

2. **Single source of truth** — Liminal is THE place for book data
3. **Reduce friction** — If it takes more than 2 taps, simplify it
4. **Data integrity** — Never lose user's notes or reading history
5. **Complete visibility** — Every book in storage visible in the app
6. **Calm UX** — Interfaces feel peaceful, not overwhelming
7. **Build complete, then migrate** — Finish features before framework changes
8. **Complete each area fully** — No scattered, half-done work
