## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine with Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for local backend development)
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+ (for local frontend development)
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended with the extensions below)

### Recommended VS Code Extensions
- Python (ms-python.python)
- Pylance (ms-python.vscode-pylance)
- ESLint (dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- Prettier (esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- Docker (ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
- GitLens (eamodio.gitlens)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liminal-ebook-manager.git
   cd liminal-ebook-manager
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   # Edit the .env files with your local configuration
   ```

3. **Start the development environment**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # View logs
   docker-compose logs -f
   
   # Stop all services
   docker-compose down
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Development Without Docker (Optional)

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run the backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Code Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- Use meaningful variable names, avoid single letters except for indices
- Docstrings required for all public functions and classes

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

async def get_books_by_author(
    db: Session,
    author_name: str,
    limit: int = 100,
    offset: int = 0
) -> List[Book]:
    """
    Retrieve books by a specific author.
    
    Args:
        db: Database session
        author_name: Name of the author to search for
        limit: Maximum number of results to return
        offset: Number of results to skip
        
    Returns:
        List of Book objects matching the author
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow [Airbnb React Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Props interfaces should be exported and properly typed
- Use meaningful component and variable names

Example:
```typescript
export interface BookCardProps {
  book: Book;
  onEdit?: (book: Book) => void;
  onDelete?: (bookId: string) => void;
  isAdmin: boolean;
}

export const BookCard: React.FC<BookCardProps> = ({
  book,
  onEdit,
  onDelete,
  isAdmin
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Git Commit Messages
Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test:` Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

Examples:
```
feat: add OPDS feed generation for user libraries
fix: correct book cover aspect ratio on mobile devices
docs: update API documentation for authentication endpoints
test: add unit tests for book metadata extraction
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following the style guides
   - Add/update tests as needed
   - Update documentation if necessary

3. **Run tests locally**
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   docker-compose exec backend pytest
   
   # Frontend tests
   docker-compose exec frontend npm test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add book series management"
   ```

5. **Push to your branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changes were made and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose exec backend pytest

# Run with coverage
docker-compose exec backend pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
docker-compose exec backend pytest tests/test_books.py

# Run tests with verbose output
docker-compose exec backend pytest -v
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose exec frontend npm test

# Run with coverage
docker-compose exec frontend npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
docker-compose exec frontend npm test -- --watch
```

### Writing Tests
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Write unit tests for all utility functions
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write component tests for all UI components
- Use meaningful test descriptions

Example backend test:
```python
def test_create_book(client: TestClient, admin_token: str):
    """Test creating a new book with valid data."""
    response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/books",
        json={
            "title": "Test Book",
            "authors": ["Test Author"],
            "isbn": "1234567890"
        },
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {admin_token}"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    data = response.json()
    assert data["title"] == "Test Book"
    assert "id" in data
```
