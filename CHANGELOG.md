## [Unreleased]

### Phase 9: Feature Completion (In Progress)
- Phase 9E Core: ✅ Complete (Jan 15-17)
- Phase 9E.5: ✅ Complete (Jan 18-19) - Collections polish (landing + detail)
- Phase 9F: ✅ Complete (Jan 25) - Book detail page overhaul
- Phase 9G: ⬅️ Next - Library/Home improvements
- Phase 9H: Stats page
- Phase 9J: Deduplication tools
- Phase 9K: Unprocessed files detection

### Technical Debt
- **Browser cache issues with covers** — After editing many book covers, changes may not reflect immediately when navigating between pages. "Use gradient" button may stop responding. Workaround: Clear browser cache for the past hour and close/reopen tab. Root cause likely related to aggressive image caching or IntersectionObserver state management. To investigate in future.

- **Checklist collection pagination infinite loop** — When viewing a checklist collection with many books (50+), scrolling to the bottom of the incomplete section causes the "Loading more books..." spinner to flicker infinitely. The IntersectionObserver keeps firing repeatedly. Attempted fixes: conditional loader rendering, removing loadingSection from effect dependencies, using refs to stabilize callback identity. Root cause is complex interaction between IntersectionObserver recreation, React useCallback identity changes, and async state updates. May need debouncing, scroll position detection instead of IntersectionObserver, or backend investigation (is `incomplete_has_more` incorrectly true?). **Workaround:** Issue only affects checklist collections; users can still use the collection with visual noise. **Priority:** Medium (cosmetic/UX).

- **TBRList → Wishlist Rename** — Storage key fixed to `liminal_sort_wishlist`, but component/file still named TBRList. Full rename deferred to React Native migration.

if (isSavingReorder) return
setIsSavingReorder(true)
try {
  await reorderBooksInCollection(id, newOrder.map(b => b.id))

## [0.26.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added

#### Phase 9E.5a: Collections Landing Page Polish 🎨
Complete UX overhaul of collections landing page with professional interaction patterns and calm aesthetics.

**3-Dot Menu:**
- Menu button (⋮) in upper right with text-only options
- "Add Collection" - Opens create modal
- "Reorder Collections" - Enters reorder mode
- "View: Grid" or "View: List" - Toggles view mode
- Menu adapts during reorder mode (only shows "Add Collection")

**Grid/List View Toggle:**
- Grid view: 2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on desktop
- List view: Single column with mini thumbnails + description
- Collection name and book count below covers in grid view
- Description shown in gray-500, smaller text, truncated in list view
- View preference persists via localStorage

**Reorder Mode:**
- Visual banner with "Reorder Mode" text and "Done" button
- Automatically switches to list view when activated
- Two labeled sections: "DEFAULT COLLECTIONS" and "MY COLLECTIONS"
- Visual separator border between default and user collections
- Drag handles (≡) only visible on user collections
- Default collections (To Be Read, Reading History) pinned at top
- Smooth drag-and-drop using @dnd-kit
- Restores previous view mode on exit

**Collection Gradients:**
- 3 expressive gradient styles:
  - **Layered Mist:** Soft atmospheric layers with overlay blend
  - **Drift Bloom:** Organic radial overlaps creating blooming effect
  - **Veiled Depth:** Subtle depth with texture using blend modes
- 2-3 colors per gradient (reduced from original 4-6)
- Softer color blending with intermediate color-mix steps
- Deterministic generation based on collection name + ID hash
- Uses same 10-color palette as book gradients
- Total: 6 gradient combinations (3 styles × 2 color variations)

**Context Menu:**
- Right-click (desktop) or long-press 500ms (mobile) on collection cards
- Text-only menu options:
  - "Edit Collection" - Opens modal with existing data
  - "Delete Collection" - Shows confirmation (hidden for defaults)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion with cancel/confirm buttons
- Menu closes when clicking outside

---

### Changed

**Collections Landing Page Layout:**
- Removed old "New" button from header
- Collection info (name + count) moved below covers in grid view
- List view shows descriptions in smaller, muted text

---

### Fixed

**Reorder Mode UX:**
- Fixed drag-and-drop index calculation using arrayMove
- Prevented view toggle during reorder mode to avoid broken state
- Removed unused previousViewMode state (localStorage guard sufficient)
- Default collections no longer show drag handles (confusing affordance removed)

**Context Menu:**
- Long-press works reliably on mobile with 500ms threshold
- Menu properly closes when clicking outside backdrop
- Context menu doesn't interfere with normal card navigation
- Menu hidden during reorder mode

---

### Technical

#### Files Added
- `frontend/src/components/CollectionGradient.jsx` — Gradient generation component

#### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/CollectionCard.jsx` — Grid/list layouts, context menu, drag handles
- `frontend/src/components/CollectionsTab.jsx` — Menu, reorder mode, view toggle, handlers
- `frontend/src/api.js` — Added reorderCollections(), deleteCollection()
- `backend/routers/collections.py` — Added POST /collections/reorder endpoint

#### Dependencies Added
- `@dnd-kit/core@^6.3.1` — Core drag-and-drop functionality
- `@dnd-kit/sortable@^10.0.0` — Sortable list support
- `@dnd-kit/utilities@^3.2.2` — Transform utilities for smooth animations

#### Gradient Algorithm
```javascript
seed = hashString(`${collectionName}-${collectionId}`)
styleIndex = seed % 3  // 0-2 (3 styles)
numColors = 2 + (seed % 2)  // 2 or 3 colors
rotation = seed % 360  // Angle in degrees
```

Soft blending uses color-mix() for intermediate stops at 25%, 50%, 75%.
